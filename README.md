# What is Maserow?
Maserow has been revamped and is no longer a database manager. Yet, it is still a tool for private servers in World of Warcraft. It is now a SQL Tool that allows to open *.csv files and show them in a gorgeous format. These *.csv files has to follow the structure otherwise it will fail.
The tool is tested on TrinityCore's 3.3.5a, however, the files may be correct in other emulators.

# Versions (Branches)
- Master: v1.0.0
- Feature: v1.0.0

# Suggestions or bugs
This project is a hobby and a solo project, which means I am developing it in my free time. Simple conclusion, I cannot find all the bugs myself and brainstorming features and layouts with others is not possible.
Therefore, it would be great when a bug occurs, thoughts on features or a new idea for a layout comes to mind, you will submit them here.
